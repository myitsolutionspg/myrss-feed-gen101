He said early disbursement allows administrators to focus on delivering quality education rather than managing financial shortfalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of K225,845,619.86 has been allocated across all school sectors, including SOF Grants, FODE, and BERC programs. The Department said the funds must be used strictly to support teaching and learning activities in classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;School heads and provincial education offices have been instructed to ensure transparency and accountability in managing the funds. The Department will also publish a full list of payments by province for public access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kombra also encouraged parents and guardians to continue supporting their children’s education and attendance throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By prioritizing these payments early in the term, we are providing school administrations with the stability they need to focus on delivering quality teaching and learning in the classroom,” Dr. Kombra said.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>UN questions PNG Government on SABL leases and illegal FCA logging</title><link>https://actnowpng.org/blog/un-questions-png-government-on-sabl-leases-and-illegal-fca-logging</link><guid>https://actnowpng.org/blog/un-questions-png-government-on-sabl-leases-and-illegal-fca-logging</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>[Act Now PNG] UN is calling for answers from the PNG government over its controversial SABL leases and the use of FCAs as cover for illegal logging operations.</description></item><item><title>UN Committee questions government on SABL leases and illegal FCA logging</title><link>https://actnowpng.org/blog/un-committee-questions-government-on-sabl-leases-and-illegal-fca-logging</link><guid>https://actnowpng.org/blog/un-committee-questions-government-on-sabl-leases-and-illegal-fca-logging</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><description>[Act Now PNG] UNCERD is calling for answers from the government over its cancellation of SABL leases and the illegal use of Forest Clearing Authorities</description></item><item><title>PNG NRL Competition finalise Club Line-Up for 2025 Season</title><link>https://pngbuzz.com/pngsport/9738</link><guid>https://pngbuzz.com/?p=9738</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 Nov 2024 04:42:15 +0000</pubDate><description>[PNG Buzz] The PNG NRL Competition has announced that the 12 existing teams will compete for the top spot in the 2025 Digicel ExxonMobil Cup, starting in April of 2025.

The programme will drive implementation of PNG’s 1-6-6 education reform and strengthen delivery of the Standards-Based Curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEizaxTI-cf_Q2ZU_LXdDhGnBFYrQr4qk5ExWt0a2sAn5uJi3KzEjmnbdgs0auKETyxBSZMAjkpHXxQkpEbDCLFkufhL6rq8kGso4dsY07VgUoR-vJQYZT5rduwOF-rqeaZDWQnubCYvaRTrFBajuT7AqarlIyydVUfPhhb3_No8ve1GwCthPfYPYv8qf1BU/s2958/PNG%20Education%20Partners.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" data-original-height="1416" data-original-width="2958" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEizaxTI-cf_Q2ZU_LXdDhGnBFYrQr4qk5ExWt0a2sAn5uJi3KzEjmnbdgs0auKETyxBSZMAjkpHXxQkpEbDCLFkufhL6rq8kGso4dsY07VgUoR-vJQYZT5rduwOF-rqeaZDWQnubCYvaRTrFBajuT7AqarlIyydVUfPhhb3_No8ve1GwCthPfYPYv8qf1BU/s16000/PNG%20Education%20Partners.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;PNG Partners Commit US$12.18m to Transform School System&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Education authorities said the reform marks a shift from the current 3-6-4 structure to 1-6-6, reshaping how students progress from elementary through secondary schooling. Emphasis will also be placed on teacher development, improved planning systems and the use of reliable data to guide decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secretary for Education Dr Uke Kombra described the grant as a practical step toward achieving national goals under the Education Plan 2020–2029.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are taking decisive action to strengthen our education system,” he said. “This grant supports our national priorities and strengthens our ability to implement the 1-6-6 reform effectively. We are investing in teachers, improving curriculum delivery and strengthening planning systems so that every child in Papua New Guinea has the opportunity to learn and succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 2.8 million children and young people are currently enrolled across PNG’s education pathways, including TVET and FODE. Officials say improving foundational literacy and numeracy, boosting retention and increasing completion rates remain pressing priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPE CEO Laura Frigenti said the partnership signals confidence in PNG’s reform direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Papua New Guinea is taking bold steps to strengthen its education system, and GPE is proud to support this reform. This grant reinforces efforts at every level of the system to deliver real improvements in learning - helping children thrive and contribute to their communities,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JICA’s Chief Representative Matsuoka Hideaki highlighted the importance of joint efforts among stakeholders, while UNICEF Acting Representative Vikas Singh stressed that stronger systems would translate into better classroom outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Quality education begins with strong systems. When we strengthen teacher capacity, improve learning materials, and use data to guide decisions, we create the conditions for children to thrive. This grant is about building an education system that sustains progress, protects investments, and brings partners together across sectors to deliver lasting results for every child.”&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Leadership Tussle Ends as Chan Sworn In as New Ireland Governor</title><link>https://thepngbulletin.com/news/politics/leadership-tussle-ends-as-chan-sworn-in-as-new-ireland-governor/</link><guid>https://thepngbulletin.com/?p=26341</guid><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 08:25:21 +0000</pubDate><description>[The PNG Bulletin] THE long-running leadership tussle between Byron Chan and Walter Schnaubelt has officially come to an end this evening, with the New Ireland Provincial Assembly swearing in Chan as Governor of the province.

Central to the plan is redevelopment work surrounding the National Football Stadium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He revealed that the adjacent Boroko Market area has been identified as a solution to future parking challenges, with plans to develop proper facilities to service spectators attending home games from 2028.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We will have a problem with car parking here so we've already started planning the appropriate place on the other side. Boroko market that's where we can offer adequate carpark for the games when it starts in 2028,” Parkop said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He further disclosed that the city authority would soon call for Expressions of Interest to construct a high-rise market building that integrates parking infrastructure and connects to the stadium via a footbridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governor Parkop said collaboration with hotels and other accommodation providers was already underway to ensure the capital is ready to welcome fans and visitors in large numbers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>🇵🇬 PNG Bilums Confirm Final 23 for Oceania World Cup Qualifiers</title><link>https://www.onepng.com/2026/02/png-bilums-confirm-final-23-for-oceania.html</link><guid>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-1653361318879330294.post-8941381891817598410</guid><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 23:17:00 +0000</pubDate><description>[One Papua New Guinea] &lt;p&gt;The squad has been officially confirmed as PNG Bilums prepare to represent Papua New Guinea at the FIFA Women’s World Cup Oceania Qualifiers in Fiji from February 27 to March 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team officials announced the final selection of 23 players who will proudly wear the red, black and gold in their quest to secure a place on football’s biggest stage.

He said leaders who had witnessed the impact of gun violence firsthand understood the urgency of immediate intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addressing concerns over ethics, Sir John said the greater moral question was whether it was right to allow bloodshed to continue in the name of principle. He argued that conventional police operations to seize weapons were costly, dangerous and often resulted in casualties among officers and civilians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He rejected claims that the program amounted to rewarding criminals, saying it instead focused on disengaging vulnerable youths who had turned to firearms due to a lack of economic opportunities. By exchanging weapons for financial assistance, he said, the Government aimed to redirect families toward agriculture and small business activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sir John also dismissed assertions that the Government was ignoring recommendations from the 2005 Singirok Report, stating that lasting reforms could not be implemented while communities remained in active conflict. He described the 21-day amnesty as a trigger for broader reforms rather than a substitute for long-term measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Opposition says ‘Nogat’ to this solution, but they offer no immediate alternative to stop the killing today. This Government says YES to peace, YES to pragmatism, and YES to a safer future for our children,” Sir John said.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Port Moresby gathers at historic Independence site to honor Late Grand Chief</title><link>https://www.postcourier.com.pg/port-moresby-gathers-at-historic-independence-site-to-honor-late-grand-chief/</link><guid>https://www.postcourier.com.pg/?p=658284</guid><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 08:48:43 +0000</pubDate><description>[Post Courier] &lt;figure&gt;&lt;img width="800" height="600" src="https://www.postcourier.com.pg/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-Moresby-gathers-at-historic-Independence-site-to-honor-Late-Grand-Chief.png?w=800" class="attachment-rss-image-size size-rss-image-size wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" srcset="https://www.postcourier.com.pg/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-Moresby-gathers-at-historic-Independence-site-to-honor-Late-Grand-Chief.png 800w, https://www.postcourier.com.pg/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-Moresby-gathers-at-historic-Independence-site-to-honor-Late-Grand-Chief.png?resize=768,576 768w, https://www.postcourier.com.pg/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-Moresby-gathers-at-historic-Independence-site-to-honor-Late-Grand-Chief.png?resize=600,450 600w, https://www.postcourier.com.pg/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-Moresby-gathers-at-historic-Independence-site-to-honor-Late-Grand-Chief.png?resize=400,300 400w, https://www.postcourier.com.pg/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-Moresby-gathers-at-historic-Independence-site-to-honor-Late-Grand-Chief.png?resize=200,150 200w, https://www.postcourier.com.pg/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-Moresby-gathers-at-historic-Independence-site-to-honor-Late-Grand-Chief.png?resize=780,585 780w, https://www.postcourier.com.pg/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-Moresby-gathers-at-historic-Independence-site-to-honor-Late-Grand-Chief.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://www.postcourier.com.pg/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-Moresby-gathers-at-historic-Independence-site-to-honor-Late-Grand-Chief.png?resize=706,530 706w, https://www.postcourier.com.pg/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-Moresby-gathers-at-historic-Independence-site-to-honor-Late-Grand-Chief.png?resize=150,113 150w" sizes="(max-width: 34.9rem) calc(100vw - 2rem), (max-width: 53rem) calc(8 * (100vw / 12)), (min-width: 53rem) calc(6 * (100vw / 12)), 100vw" data-attachment-id="658287" data-permalink="https://www.postcourier.com.pg/port-moresby-gathers-at-historic-independence-site-to-honor-late-grand-chief/port-moresby-gathers-at-historic-independence-site-to-honor-late-grand-chief/" data-orig-file="https://www.postcourier.com.pg/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-Moresby-gathers-at-historic-Independence-site-to-honor-Late-Grand-Chief.png" data-orig-size="800,600" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;credit&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;camera&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;caption&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;created_timestamp&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;copyright&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;focal_length&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iso&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;shutter_speed&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;orientation&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;0&amp;quot;}" data-image-title="Port Moresby gathers at historic Independence site to honor Late Grand Chief" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://www.postcourier.com.pg/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-Moresby-gathers-at-historic-Independence-site-to-honor-Late-Grand-Chief.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://www.postcourier.com.pg/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Port-Moresby-gathers-at-historic-Independence-site-to-honor-Late-Grand-Chief.png?w=800" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;River communities in Western Province are increasingly turning to long-tail boat engines, commonly known by villagers as “Kabota”, as an affordable and reliable mode of transport along the Fly River system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-tail boat engines, or long-tail mud motors locally known as Kabota by Fly River villagers in Middle Fly District and parts of North Fly and South Fly, have become one of the most dependable river transport options that villagers can now afford.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister James Marape has called on the people of Papua New Guinea to pause in solemn reflection as the nation marks the fifth anniversary of the passing of the late Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare, the Founding Father of the Nation. Speaking today, Prime Minister Marape noted that this anniversary carries significant weight as it coincides with Papua New Guinea’s 50th year of Independence, framing it as a pivotal moment for both remembrance and national introspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This week, we honor the life, leadership, and enduring spirit of the man who led us to independence and shaped our foundations,” the Prime Minister said. “Five years since his passing, and fifty years since our birth as a nation, this is a time to reflect deeply on the standards Sir Michael set for us all.”&lt;/p&gt;
